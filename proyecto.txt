Mississippi Queen
You know what I mean
Mississippi Queen
She taught me everything
Went down around Vicksburg
Around Louisiana way
Where lived the Cajun Lady
Aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine
Mississippi Queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen
She taught me everything
This lady she asked me
If I would be her man
You know that I told her
I'd do what I can
To keep her lookin' pretty
Buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes were makin' their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was loosin' mine
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine
Yeah, Mississippi Queen

2-iron man
-letra
I am Iron Man
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves, will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again

3-paranoid
-letra 
Finished with my woman 'cause
She couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because
I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make
True happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late

4-livin on a prayer
-letra
Once upon a time not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day working for her man
She brings home her pay, for love, for love
She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
Baby, it's okay, someday
We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer
Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer

5-TNT
-letra
Oi, oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
See me ride out of the sunset
On your color TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun, ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight
'Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
T.N.T. I'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode!
I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand?
So lock up your daughter, lock up your wife
Lock up your back door, run for your life
The man is back in town
So don't you mess me 'round
'Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
T.N.T. I'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode!
T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
T.N.T. I'm dynamite (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T. and I'll win the fight (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T. I'm a power load (oi, oi, oi)
T.N.T. watch me explode!

Takin' everythin' in my stride

Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too

Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey satan

Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey mumma
Look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell

And I'm goin' down
All the way
I'm on the highway to hell

10-kickstart my heart 
-letra
 When I get high I get high on speed
Top fuel funny car's a drug for me
My heart, my heart
Kick start my heart
Always got the cops coming after me
Custom-built bike doing 103
My heart, my heart
Kick start my heart
Oh, are you ready girls?
Oh, are you ready now?
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, baby
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby, yeah
Skydive naked from an aeroplane
Or a lady with a body from outer space
My heart, my heart
Kick start my heart
Say I got trouble, trouble in my eyes
I'm just looking for another good time
My heart, my heart
Kick start my heart
Yeah, are you ready girls?
Yeah, are you ready now, now, now?
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, baby, whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby
When we started this band
All we needed, needed was a laugh
Years gone by, I'd say we've kicked some ass
When I'm enraged or hittin' the stage
Adrenaline rushing through my veins
And I'd say we're still kickin' ass
I say, ooh ah, kick start my heart
I hope it never stops
And to think, we did all of this to rock
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, b-b-b-b-b-b-baby
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby

Kick start my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah
Okay boys, let's rock the house
