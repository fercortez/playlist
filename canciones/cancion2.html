        <h2>
            Letra
        </h2>

        <p>I am Iron Man</p>
        <p>Has he lost his mind?<br>
            Can he see or is he blind?<br>
            Can he walk at all<br>
            Or if he moves, will he fall?</p>
        <p>Is he alive or dead?<br>
            Has he thoughts within his head?<br>
            We'll just pass him there<br>
            Why should we even care?</p>
        <p>He was turned to steel<br>
            In the great magnetic field<br>
            When he traveled time<br>
            For the future of mankind</p>
        <p>Nobody wants him<br>
            He just stares at the world<br>
            Planning his vengeance<br>
            That he will soon unfurl</p>
        <p>Now the time is here<br>
            For Iron Man to spread fear<br>
            Vengeance from the grave<br>
            Kills the people he once saved</p>
        <p>Nobody wants him<br>
            They just turn their heads<br>
            Nobody helps him<br>
            Now he has his revenge</p>
        <p>Heavy boots of lead<br>
            Fills his victims full of dread<br>
            Running as fast as they can<br>
            Iron Man lives again</p>
