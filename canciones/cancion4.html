        <h2>
            Letra
        </h2>

        <p>Once upon a time not so long ago</p>
        <p>Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike<br>
            He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough<br>
            Gina works the diner all day working for her man<br>
            She brings home her pay, for love, for love</p>
        <p>She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
            It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
            We've got each other and that's a lot for love<br>
            We'll give it a shot</p>
        <p>Woah, we're half way there<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</p>
        <p>Tommy's got his six-string in hock<br>
            Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk<br>
            So tough, it's tough<br>
            Gina dreams of running away<br>
            When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers<br>
            Baby, it's okay, someday</p>
        <p>We've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
            It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
            We've got each other and that's a lot for love<br>
            We'll give it a shot</p>
        <p>Woah, we're half way there<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
            Livin' on a prayer</p>
        <p>Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not<br>
            You live for the fight when it's all that you've got<br>
            Woah, we're half way there<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</p>
        <p>Woah, we're half way there<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</p>
        <p>Woah, we're half way there<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</p>
